An R markdown file for exploring the NWSL data!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
nwsl <- read.csv("../Data/nwsl_season_stats.csv")
str(nwsl)
```

Generate some exploratory graphs...

looking at goals by position
```{r}
nwsl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = goals, y = pos)) +
  geom_violin()
```
how many players are there at each position anyway?

```{r}
nwsl %>%
  group_by(pos) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
```
maybe it would be better to make the people who are two positions actually be only one position? to clean the data?
